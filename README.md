# megamap

MegaRAID&trade; Linux drive mapper

## Usage

Run the `megamap` script and it will produce a map of MegaRAID drive ID to Linux drive `sd*` and also displays the WWN from Linux.

## Requirements

* you need the [`megacli`](http://askubuntu.com/questions/488612/how-do-i-install-the-lsi-megacli-in-ubuntu) tool which needs to be run as `root`
* [Readonly](https://metacpan.org/pod/Readonly) Perl module (debian package `libreadonly-perl`)

## Usage

`megamap` takes no arguments and outputs a table of drive mappings such as:

	$ sudo megamap
	0       sdc     0x5000cca02ab9e1a0
	1       sdf     0x5000cca02ab9b548
	2       sde     0x5000cca02ab9bad0
	3       sdd     0x5000cca02ab9b928
	4       sdh     0x5000cca02ab9b5e8
	5       sdg     0x5000cca02ab9b86c
	6       sdj     0x5000cca02ab9b8c0
	7       sdi     0x5000cca02ab9dde8
	8       sdn     0x5000cca02ab9b34c
	9       sdk     0x5000cca02ab9e7d8
	10      sdl     0x5000cca02ab9e0c0
	11      sdm     0x5000cca02ab9b350

`megablink` takes arguments of linux drives like `/dev/sda` or without the full
path such as `sdb` and starts that drive blinking.  Unblinking happens when the
drive is replaced automatically, but there is also a `megaunblink` in case you
accidentally blink the wrong drive.  `megablink -u` also unblinks a drive.

	$ sudo ./megablink /dev/sdn
	blinking drive 8 (sdn), running megacli -PdLocate -start -physdrv[0:8] -a0
                                     
	Adapter: 0: Device at EnclId-0 SlotId-8  -- PD Locate Start Command was successfully sent to Firmware 

	Exit Code: 0x00

## Notes

* :foggy: the Linux WWN is off-by-one or a few from what `megacli` shows.
* :clap: thanks to http://serverfault.com/questions/381177/megacli-get-the-dev-sd-device-name-for-a-logical-drive/ for getting me to look in `/dev/disk/by-id`
* :clap: thanks to http://www.network-administrator.co.uk/?p=575 for providing a handy reference to the `megacli` command structure
* :snake: [lsidrivemap](https://github.com/louwrentius/lsidrivemap) is similar to `megamap`, but written in python and it has a nice table output format that shows the layout of the drives on the front of the server.
* :clap: thanks to [Harry Lee](https://github.com/tclh123) for providing my first bug report and testing my eventual fix.  It is really :doughnut: great to know one person is using my project.

## Support

Please file a new [issue on github](https://github.com/chicks-net/megamap/issues) with
the output from:

* `megacli -pdlist -a0 | egrep 'Slot|^SAS'`
* `ls -l /dev/disk/by-id`
* `uname -a`
* `lsb_release -a`

The included script `megatrouble` will give you all of this in a format ready to post into an issue.


## Debug Mode

If you set the `MEGAMAP_DEBUG` environment variable it won't run `megacli` or
`ls` directly, but instead it will pull the data out of static files
`/tmp/megacli.out` and `/tmp/ls.out`.  If everything is working properly you
should be able to generate those files like so:

	megacli -pdlist -a0 | egrep 'Slot|^SAS' > /tmp/megacli.out
	ls -l /dev/disk/by-id | grep -v part > /tmp/ls.out

## Ideas

* docs in POD
* verify that it works on a system with more than 26 attached drives (the author does not currently have access to such a system)
* support multiple adapters through command line arguments or environment variables
